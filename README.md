### üñäÔ∏è Lab 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition

#### Objective:
This lab introduces the foundational concepts of deep learning through a classic image classification task. You‚Äôll explore the limitations of traditional programming approaches and understand how neural networks can solve pattern recognition problems effectively.

#### Key Concepts Covered:
- Introduction to the MNIST dataset
- Data loading and preprocessing using torchvision
- Designing and training a simple feedforward neural network with PyTorch
- Evaluating model performance on handwritten digits

#### Dataset Used:
MNIST (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels)

#### Frameworks & Tools:
PyTorch, Torchvision

#### Key Learnings:
This exercise demonstrated how to build a basic neural network for digit classification using PyTorch. By training the model on MNIST, it achieved high accuracy on unseen data, showcasing the capability of deep learning models to generalize from relatively small and structured datasets. It also reinforced the importance of proper data preparation and model architecture in achieving good performance.
